  <article class="post-content">
    <p>We alll live this life first time and we have only basic concepts in our gens how life is look like. We need to go through life, give it a shot and see what we can achieve or feel. Or we can read books and use other people’s experiences. Seems easy, right, but in practice, it’s not.
Why? Because we are hoomans. Period.
<br>
I want to share my opinion and experience about why it is not easy to live this life and share with you some practical approaches.
<br>
I’m mainly a software engineer, I say mainly because I don’t like to be associated with only my profession. Once in the school, in an informatics lesson where we were learning some basic concepts of programming I(read my brain) realized that “Oh we can actually automate things, do something once and reuse the solution after that, great”. Yes here we can do the first inference, our brains are lazy).  After that, I decided to go with programmer pat. I study computer science at university and started to work as a programmer. Started to receive first salaries.
I started to think about how I wanted to live this life.
<br></p>
<ul>
   <li>First thing is finances. My first books were about successful people and about their life paths as examples of life, as a consequence started to think about success, and this followed to financial stability topic. This is one of the main pillars of how to live this life. 
The first book about finance was “Rich dad, poor dad”. From my today’s view, it is a little bit naive book, but at that period it gave me the idea that I can control something, in this case, finances, and have achievements. This gave me the feeling that I can make money and feel good. But again we are humans and everything is not that easy.</li>
    <li>The next thing we have to consider is our neural system. It is really big, and they say home-sapience is the most intelligent mammal so far. That means our neural system is extra compared to our bodies. This makes us not as determined as animals. And I read that our neural system becomes self-aware later in our 20s. We can call this process Constant ripening. Whether we want it or not, we become more and more self-aware during this time. Carl Young used a very good term The shadow, which refers to parts of our whole self that we don't know about ourselves yet. So the fact of the existence of this shadow and fact that our neural system is complex makes our connection to the world around us a complex process.</li>
    <li>One more thing is the Dominance principle in the brain. As the neural system advances, we started to want many things, and we start to receive much more signals from our bodies as well.
Life itself becomes a complex process because we are complex for ourselves. We start to have inner conflicts and we start to ask what is important to ourselves cause we don't have that many resources to provide for all our wants. The neural system has lower parts, from the mammal level, like the vagus nerve, and also has higher parts, action result acceptors, like dynamic stereotyping systems. At the same time, different parts of our neural system have different architectures, which motivate different behaviors.</li>
</ul>
<p>At some point, our brain needs and decided to find or create a system where it can function properly and with discipline. There are plenty of systems on the internet, but I only know some of them and have tried only a couple of them. An interesting one is Japanese ikigai, I need to read it more still and marinade it to see what results and feelings it can bring.
<br>
I want to share 3 concepts that help me.
<br></p>
<ul>
    <li>The first one is from positive psychology, here is the image. Basically, this is like a reminder and you have to keep the balance you choose between these 4 components of life. You give them a priority and then keep it. </li>
    <li>Next is the Emotional ladder. Here is the image. Here you need to recognize at what emotional level you are right now, and with questioning yourself go up and up on this ladder until you can start to feel the emotion that is appropriate to the current situation.</li>
    <li>And the last one is the Lean startup approach, here is the image. Here you are acting iteratively and delivering results without judging yourself. This is the same Constant ripening approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>So here is my experience of understanding how to live this life. Of course, you have to have goals. And you can try these approaches in your daily life and see will they be effective for your goals.</p>
