Seems a new trend.
I've been working remotely even before the pandemic. After the pandemic, it became mainstream. Before pandemic this way of working was called freelance) but I was always using the wording remote. Even today there are people who say freelance). 
<br>
In this half-baked article, I want to share with you how I see and feel remote work, its advantages, and disadvantages from my view. This is going to be my reflection on my recent work experience.
<br>
I live in Yerevan, some people say silicon valley of Caucasus. Some sort of true, Yerevan has good weather and there are startups with good people, professionals and investments. No FAANG or FAANGoid company presence yet.
<br>
So in general, I like working remotely. First of all, on an intuitive level,  you can have the smell of freedom. I want to mention the 4 main practical day-to-day advantages of remote work and at the same time dark sides of these advantages.
<ul>
    <li>First thing first, you work when you want. More concrete you can decide when to wake up, and of course, most probably youâ€™ll wake up when you get your sleep fully, which is great. I am used to doing this in this way, some days I wake up at 9 am, some days around 12 pm. I based on what I have to do that day, decide to sleep more or less.</li>
    <li>Second, you have the freedom of scheduling your day, I would say you decide your agenda. When you can do your tasks, what tasks do first, what to keep for later. I can say I have a more authentic way of working. You don't have to go to the office where you are not always as productive as you want and you have to deal with redundant requirements. I work from home and sometimes choose coworking.</li>
    <li>The next point is related to knowledge and culture sharing. Being working with abroad people from Europe and America brings you to a state where you can get new knowledge of how to interact in the team in a more respectful and efficient way.</li>
    <li>And finally, I want to say the financial part, it can be improved because you can work for European/American companies.</li>
</ul>
Pretty good huh.
<hr>
And here are the disadvantages, the dark sides. Let's show off them.
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Because I decide when to wake up, it makes me a little lazy, and I lose some level of discipline, despite I found a solution for this. I go to the gym and keep myself disciplined.</li>
    <li>Then we have an issue with not going to an office, here you are losing connections with people who can be interesting to you, you don't see people too often, you can only interact with them on online platforms.</li>
    <li>Next, because you work more with other countries' cultures, you are losing your country's way of working, and you can become less connected to your country. At the same time, you don't get full benefits from other countries as well, for ex., many companies don't give you share options.</li> 
    <li>And the last one is related to compensation. From first sight there is no disadvantage here)), but what is bad is that you start to think about money as the only stimuli of work, that's really bad. <blockquote> You just need to remember money won't make you smart. </blockquote></li>
</ul>
This were my reflection on working remotely, I think I may come time to time to this article and do updates.
