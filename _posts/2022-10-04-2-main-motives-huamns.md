From the book The Denial of Death written by Ernest Becker, we can take out that humans have 2 anthropological wants, motives that didn't go anywhere in the 21st century. Ernest Becker was an American cultural anthropologist. Anthropology is the scientific study of humanity, concerned with human behavior, human biology, cultures, societies, and linguistics, in both the present and past, including past human species.
<br><br>
2 main motives are the following : <b>Feeling special and Belonging to something larger</b>. Moving forward I can say we have to balance these motives.

Yes, dear ladies and gentlemen, we all know that we are mortal, and at some point we will not be, but life will continue to evolve. Since people cannot overcome this fact, we begin to think that, okay, even if we are going to be erased from life, then at least let's live an important and vital life)). <i>This thing in fact can make life suffer less painful.</i> People do many things to feel important, you name it. People even go to jobs and make money)) , they are use social networks , buy things and also eat too much.
<br><br>
Because life is very dynamic nowadays, our brain is always under constant overstimulation. And at some point, our behavior can become pathological.  
<ul>
<li>If someone is too focused on the first motivation, they can suddenly become a narcissist, they will begin to give almost nothing to others, which means they will lose their humanity. This means that these people will begin to love only themselves, and also in others they will begin to love and seek only love directed at them.</li>
<li>If someone will be too focused on the second motivation they for sure will become anxious. They will start to give too much and lose themself, and in the end, again lose humanity. This means these individuals will start to forget about them and become useless and pointless.</li>
</ul>
So we have to give ourselves to others without losing ourselves. We have to share equality and support ,and as a result, we will end up in equilibriums, in balance. We must take care of ourselves first.
<br>
Smaller things that people need to start to appreciate are self-expression, which can a little bit satisfy the motivation to feel special, and family, friends which will satisfy the motivation to be part of something larger.
We need to make others feel important and that way we should feel important. We must be in what I call evolutionary attractive communication. Also in the workplace, we have to appreciate the work of employees and coworkers. We have to respect others and create things together. You can find some approaches <a href="https://narekyan.github.io/blog/2022/how-to-live-this-life/">here</a> about how to live life constructively.
<br><br>
Well, there is also one more question: why we need to be human and respect others at all? We just need to always remember that we are stronger together and this is not a romantic statement.
<br>
Thanks for reading , now I will go and eat my greek salad to feel special and wait for your comments and thoughts to feel part of something larger.
